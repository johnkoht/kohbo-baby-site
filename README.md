# Middleman Base

This repo is a base template for creating new Middleman projects at Kohactive. It's fairly opinionated.

## Setup

**Clone the repo**

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/kohactive/middleman_base
```

**Setup your environment**
Make sure that the ruby environment files are setup properly. The default ruby version is `2.4.1` and the gemset is `middleman_base`. If you want to modify these, change the appropriate file. Don't forget to run `cd .` if you change any of those files.

**Run the setup script**

```bash
$ bin/setup
```

## Run the project

To run Middleman, simple call:

```bash
$ middleman
```
